DDD refers to the detection of driver drowsiness.\
As we know that there are a lot of car accidents due to drowsiness of the driver while driving. [Source](https://www.nsc.org/road/safety-topics/fatigued-driver).\
We also know the progress of science in creating self-driving cars to reduce the rate of those accidents,\
but the average cost of self-driving cars is $30,000 [Source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/uhenergy/2019/05/21/self-driving-automobiles-how-soon-and-how-much/?sh=2f7d9e2638bd), and as we know this is a high price.\
And here comes our role to solve this problem in a smart and low-cost way.
